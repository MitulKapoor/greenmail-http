# GreenMail HTTP Frontend
Maven builds this package as part of the main build but if you'd like to develop it then it's easy.

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

A web browser will open automatically showing the front page.
You must have the GreenMail HTTP application running (obviously!).
If you get CORS issues then consider adding [ac_anywhere](../../../README.md#user-content-run-with-access-control-allow-origin).
